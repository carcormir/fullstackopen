The Notes page of the application follows an early-nineties 
style of web development and uses "Ajax". As such, it's on 
the crest of the wave of early 2000's web technology.

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a term introduced 
in February 2005 on the back of advancements in browser 
technology to describe a new revolutionary approach that
enabled the fetching of content to web pages using 
JavaScript included within the HTML, without the need to 
rerender the page.

## Single page application -> SPA ##
####################################
In recent years, the Single-page application (SPA) 
style of creating web-applications has emerged. 
SPA-style websites don't fetch all of their pages separately 
from the server like our sample application does, but instead
comprise only one HTML page fetched from the server, 
the contents of which are manipulated with JavaScript that 
executes in the browser.
